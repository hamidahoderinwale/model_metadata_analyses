# Stable Diffusion v2-1 Model Card
This model card focuses on the model associated with the Stable Diffusion v2-1 model, codebase available [here](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion).

This `stable-diffusion-2-1` model is fine-tuned from [stable-diffusion-2](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2) (`768-v-ema.ckpt`) with an additional 55k steps on the same dataset (with `punsafe=0.1`), and then fine-tuned for another 155k extra steps with `punsafe=0.98`.

- Use it with the [`stablediffusion`](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion) repository: download the `v2-1_768-ema-pruned.ckpt` [here](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1/blob/main/v2-1_768-ema-pruned.ckpt).
- Use it with 🧨 [`diffusers`](#examples)

      }


## Examples

Using the [🤗's Diffusers library](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) to run Stable Diffusion 2 in a simple and efficient manner.

```bash
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate scipy safetensors
```
Running the pipeline (if you don't swap the scheduler it will run with the default DDIM, in this example we are swapping it to DPMSolverMultistepScheduler):

```python
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline, DPMSolverMultistepScheduler

model_id = ""stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1""

# Use the DPMSolverMultistepScheduler (DPM-Solver++) scheduler here instead
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)
pipe = pipe.to(""cuda"")

prompt = ""a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars""
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
    
image.save(""astronaut_rides_horse.png"")
```

**Notes**:
- Despite not being a dependency, we highly recommend you to install [xformers](https://github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) for memory efficient attention (better performance)
- If you have low GPU RAM available, make sure to add a `pipe.enable_attention_slicing()` after sending it to `cuda` for less VRAM usage (to the cost of speed)


# Uses

## Direct Use 
The model is intended for research purposes only. Possible research areas and tasks include

- Safe deployment of models which have the potential to generate harmful content.
- Probing and understanding the limitations and biases of generative models.
- Generation of artworks and use in design and other artistic processes.
- Applications in educational or creative tools.
- Research on generative models.

Excluded uses are described below.

 ### Misuse, Malicious Use, and Out-of-Scope Use
_Note: This section is originally taken from the [DALLE-MINI model card](https://huggingface.co/dalle-mini/dalle-mini), was used for Stable Diffusion v1, but applies in the same way to Stable Diffusion v2_.

The model should not be used to intentionally create or disseminate images that create hostile or alienating environments for people. This includes generating images that people would foreseeably find disturbing, distressing, or offensive; or content that propagates historical or current stereotypes.

#### Out-of-Scope Use
The model was not trained to be factual or true representations of people or events, and therefore using the model to generate such content is out-of-scope for the abilities of this model.

#### Misuse and Malicious Use
Using the model to generate content that is cruel to individuals is a misuse of this model. This includes, but is not limited to:

- Generating demeaning, dehumanizing, or otherwise harmful representations of people or their environments, cultures, religions, etc.
- Intentionally promoting or propagating discriminatory content or harmful stereotypes.
- Impersonating individuals without their consent.
- Sexual content without consent of the people who might see it.
- Mis- and disinformation
- Representations of egregious violence and gore
- Sharing of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.
- Sharing content that is an alteration of copyrighted or licensed material in violation of its terms of use.

## Limitations and Bias

### Limitations

- The model does not achieve perfect photorealism
- The model cannot render legible text
- The model does not perform well on more difficult tasks which involve compositionality, such as rendering an image corresponding to “A red cube on top of a blue sphere”
- Faces and people in general may not be generated properly.
- The model was trained mainly with English captions and will not work as well in other languages.
- The autoencoding part of the model is lossy
- The model was trained on a subset of the large-scale dataset
  [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), which contains adult, violent and sexual content. To partially mitigate this, we have filtered the dataset using LAION's NFSW detector (see Training section).

### Bias
While the capabilities of image generation models are impressive, they can also reinforce or exacerbate social biases. 
Stable Diffusion was primarily trained on subsets of [LAION-2B(en)](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), 
which consists of images that are limited to English descriptions. 
Texts and images from communities and cultures that use other languages are likely to be insufficiently accounted for. 
This affects the overall output of the model, as white and western cultures are often set as the default. Further, the 
ability of the model to generate content with non-English prompts is significantly worse than with English-language prompts.
Stable Diffusion v2 mirrors and exacerbates biases to such a degree that viewer discretion must be advised irrespective of the input or its intent.


## Training

**Training Data**
The model developers used the following dataset for training the model:

- LAION-5B and subsets (details below). The training data is further filtered using LAION's NSFW detector, with a ""p_unsafe"" score of 0.1 (conservative). For more details, please refer to LAION-5B's [NeurIPS 2022](https://openreview.net/forum?id=M3Y74vmsMcY) paper and reviewer discussions on the topic.

**Training Procedure**
Stable Diffusion v2 is a latent diffusion model which combines an autoencoder with a diffusion model that is trained in the latent space of the autoencoder. During training, 

- Images are encoded through an encoder, which turns images into latent representations. The autoencoder uses a relative downsampling factor of 8 and maps images of shape H x W x 3 to latents of shape H/f x W/f x 4
- Text prompts are encoded through the OpenCLIP-ViT/H text-encoder.
- The output of the text encoder is fed into the UNet backbone of the latent diffusion model via cross-attention.
- The loss is a reconstruction objective between the noise that was added to the latent and the prediction made by the UNet. We also use the so-called _v-objective_, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512.

We currently provide the following checkpoints:

- `512-base-ema.ckpt`: 550k steps at resolution `256x256` on a subset of [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) filtered for explicit pornographic material, using the [LAION-NSFW classifier](https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLIP-based-NSFW-Detector) with `punsafe=0.1` and an [aesthetic score](https://github.com/christophschuhmann/improved-aesthetic-predictor) >= `4.5`.
  850k steps at resolution `512x512` on the same dataset with resolution `>= 512x512`.
- `768-v-ema.ckpt`: Resumed from `512-base-ema.ckpt` and trained for 150k steps using a [v-objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00512) on the same dataset. Resumed for another 140k steps on a `768x768` subset of our dataset.
- `512-depth-ema.ckpt`: Resumed from `512-base-ema.ckpt` and finetuned for 200k steps. Added an extra input channel to process the (relative) depth prediction produced by [MiDaS](https://github.com/isl-org/MiDaS) (`dpt_hybrid`) which is used as an additional conditioning.
The additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized.
- `512-inpainting-ema.ckpt`: Resumed from `512-base-ema.ckpt` and trained for another 200k steps. Follows the mask-generation strategy presented in [LAMA](https://github.com/saic-mdal/lama) which, in combination with the latent VAE representations of the masked image, are used as an additional conditioning.
The additional input channels of the U-Net which process this extra information were zero-initialized. The same strategy was used to train the [1.5-inpainting checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting).
- `x4-upscaling-ema.ckpt`: Trained for 1.25M steps on a 10M subset of LAION containing images `>2048x2048`. The model was trained on crops of size `512x512` and is a text-guided [latent upscaling diffusion model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752).
In addition to the textual input, it receives a `noise_level` as an input parameter, which can be used to add noise to the low-resolution input according to a [predefined diffusion schedule](configs/stable-diffusion/x4-upscaling.yaml). 

- **Hardware:** 32 x 8 x A100 GPUs
- **Optimizer:** AdamW
- **Gradient Accumulations**: 1
- **Batch:** 32 x 8 x 2 x 4 = 2048
- **Learning rate:** warmup to 0.0001 for 10,000 steps and then kept constant

## Evaluation Results 
Evaluations with different classifier-free guidance scales (1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0,
5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0) and 50 steps DDIM sampling steps show the relative improvements of the checkpoints:

![pareto](model-variants.jpg) 

Evaluated using 50 DDIM steps and 10000 random prompts from the COCO2017 validation set, evaluated at 512x512 resolution.  Not optimized for FID scores.

## Environmental Impact

**Stable Diffusion v1** **Estimated Emissions**
Based on that information, we estimate the following CO2 emissions using the [Machine Learning Impact calculator](https://mlco2.github.io/impact#compute) presented in [Lacoste et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09700). The hardware, runtime, cloud provider, and compute region were utilized to estimate the carbon impact.

- **Hardware Type:** A100 PCIe 40GB
- **Hours used:** 200000
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS
- **Compute Region:** US-east
- **Carbon Emitted (Power consumption x Time x Carbon produced based on location of power grid):** 15000 kg CO2 eq.

# **Stable Diffusion 2-Based Gray-Inpainting to RGB**


1. **Gray-Inpainting Model**: Fills missing regions of a grayscale image using a masked inpainting diffusion process based on an autoencoder (AE) instead of a variational autoencoder (VAE). It Contains mask dectector to enable restoration without mask information(or you can pass explicitly)

2. **Gray-to-RGB Conversion Model**: Converts the grayscale image (or inpainted output) into a full-color RGB image by adding a residual path in the AE. internel unet directly predicts difference between gray and color image's latent

### thumbsUp_v2 on Stable Diffusion
This is the `<thumbs-up>` concept taught to Stable Diffusion via Textual Inversion. You can load this concept into the [Stable Conceptualizer](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/stable_conceptualizer_inference.ipynb) notebook. You can also train your own concepts and load them into the concept libraries using [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/diffusers/sd_textual_inversion_training.ipynb).

Here is the new concept you will be able to use as an `object`:

# Text-to-image finetuning - GabrielGaleana34/sd-model-finetuned

This pipeline was finetuned from **stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1** on the **GabrielGaleana34/Products** dataset. Below are some example images generated with the finetuned pipeline using the following prompts: ['[A Coca-cola soda in a plastic bottle]']: 

![val_imgs_grid](./val_imgs_grid.png)


## Pipeline usage

You can use the pipeline like so:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(""GabrielGaleana34/sd-model-finetuned"", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
prompt = ""A Coca-cola soda in a plastic bottle""
image = pipeline(prompt).images[0]
image.save(""my_image.png"")
```

## Training info

These are the key hyperparameters used during training:

* Epochs: 89
* Learning rate: 1e-06
* Batch size: 1
* Gradient accumulation steps: 4
* Image resolution: 1024
* Mixed-precision: fp16

You can use the pipeline like so:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(""juliajoanna/sd2-1-flintstones-model"", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
prompt = ""Fred is driving a car""
image = pipeline(prompt).images[0]
image.save(""my_image.png"")
```

# Text-to-image finetuning - suvadityamuk/stable-diffusion-japanese-kanji

This pipeline was finetuned from **stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1** on the **suvadityamuk/japanese-kanji** dataset. Below are some example images generated with the finetuned pipeline using the following prompts: ['deep learning', 'elon musk', 'india', 'sakana', 'fish', 'foundation', 'neural network', 'machine learning', 'man', 'woman', 'tokyo', 'mumbai', 'google', 'youtube', 'deepmind', 'attention', 'diffusion', 'stability']: 

![val_imgs_grid](./val_imgs_grid.png)


## Pipeline usage

You can use the pipeline like so:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(""suvadityamuk/stable-diffusion-japanese-kanji"", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
prompt = ""deep learning""
image = pipeline(prompt).images[0]
image.save(""my_image.png"")
```

## Training info

These are the key hyperparameters used during training:

* Epochs: 20
* Learning rate: 0.00025
* Batch size: 128
* Gradient accumulation steps: 4
* Image resolution: 128
* Mixed-precision: bf16


More information on all the CLI arguments and the environment are available on your [`wandb` run page](https://wandb.ai/suvadityamuk/sakana-kanji/runs/ymtm4e77).

# Text-to-image finetuning - yurman/mri-sd-v21-oasis

This pipeline was finetuned from **stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1**
on the **OASIS-3** dataset for brain image generation.
Below are some example images generated with the finetuned pipeline: 

![val_imgs_grid](./val_imgs_grid.png)


## Pipeline usage

You can use the pipeline like so:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(""yurman/mri-sd-v21-oasis"", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
prompt = ""An empty, flat black image with a MRI brain axial scan in the center""
image = pipeline(prompt).images[0]
image.save(""my_image.png"")
```

## Training info

These are the key hyperparameters used during training:

* Epochs: 25
* Learning rate: 5e-05
* embeds rate: 5e-05
* Batch size: 4
* Classifier free guidance: 1
* VAE scaling: Same as in the original model
* Input perturbation: 0.0
* Noise offset: 0
* Gradient accumulation steps: 4
* Image resolution: 384
* Mixed-precision: None
* Max rotation degree: 0.0


More information on all the CLI arguments and the environment are available on your [`wandb` run page](https://wandb.ai/mri-diffusion/mri-sd-v21-oasis/runs/1y1nwdh2).

## Pipeline usage

You can use the pipeline like so:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(""ikozlov/sd-laion-art"", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
prompt = ""A man in a suit""
image = pipeline(prompt).images[0]
image.save(""my_image.png"")
```

## Training info

# Text-to-image finetuning - Fnatax75811ekpostacom/sd-laion-art_2

This pipeline was finetuned from **stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1** on the **fantasyfish/laion-art** dataset. Below are some example images generated with the finetuned pipeline using the following prompts: ['A man in a suit']: 

![val_imgs_grid](./val_imgs_grid.png)


## Pipeline usage

You can use the pipeline like so:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(""Fnatax75811ekpostacom/sd-laion-art_2"", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
prompt = ""A man in a suit""
image = pipeline(prompt).images[0]
image.save(""my_image.png"")
```

## Training info

These are the key hyperparameters used during training:

* Epochs: 100
* Learning rate: 1e-05
* Batch size: 16
* Gradient accumulation steps: 4
* Image resolution: 512
* Mixed-precision: None

We organize a large-scale dataset composed of a series of object detection datasets to train a more general model named Stable Box Diffusion based on ODGEN. 

We employ 10 datasets including COCO2014, OpenImagesv7, Object365,  PasvalVOC2007, PascalVOC2012, ImageNet, RUOD, nuScenes, ADE20K, and BDD100K, which covers about 31 million images and more than 5300 categories of objects. Our Stable Box Diffusion is trained on x24 NVIDIA A6000 GPUs with batch size 96 for 20 epochs. It costs 42 days and more than 24000 GPU hours in total.

# Text-to-image finetuning - CasperLD/cartoon_generation_sd_v1

This pipeline was finetuned from **stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1** on the **CasperLD/cartoons_with_blip_captions_512_max_3000_at_fg_s_sp** dataset. Below are some example images generated with the finetuned pipeline using the following prompts: ['cartoon character with big eyes']: 

![val_imgs_grid](./val_imgs_grid.png)


## Pipeline usage

You can use the pipeline like so:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
import torch

pipeline = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(""CasperLD/cartoon_generation_sd_v1"", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
prompt = ""cartoon character with big eyes""
image = pipeline(prompt).images[0]
image.save(""my_image.png"")
```

## Training info

These are the key hyperparameters used during training:

* Epochs: 25
* Learning rate: 1e-05
* Batch size: 4
* Gradient accumulation steps: 1
* Image resolution: 512
* Mixed-precision: fp16



## Intended uses & limitations

# Ano-Face-Fair: Race-Fair Face Anonymization in Text-to-Image Synthesis using Simple Preference Optimization in Diffusion Model

For detailed information, code, and documentation, please visit our GitHub repository:
[Ano-Face-Fair](https://github.com/i3n7g3/Ano-Face-Fair)

## Ano-Face-Fair

![Ano-Face-Fair demo images](./assets/Fig1.png)

## Model

![overall_structure](./assets/Fig2.png)

**Ano-Face-Fair** presents a novel approach to text-to-face synthesis using a Diffusion Model that considers Race Fairness. Our method uses facial segmentation masks to edit specific facial regions, and employs a Stable Diffusion v2 Inpainting model trained on a curated Asian dataset. We introduce two key losses: **ℒ𝐹𝐹𝐸** (Focused Feature Enhancement Loss) to enhance performance with limited data, and **ℒ𝑫𝑰𝑭𝑭** (Difference Loss) to address catastrophic forgetting. Finally, we apply **Simple Preference Optimization** (SimPO) for refined and enhanced image generation.

## Model Checkpoints

- [SimPO-LoRA (Diffusion model with **Simple Preference Optimization**)](https://huggingface.co/i3n7g3/SimPO-LoRA-Diffusion)

### Using with Diffusers🧨

You can use this model directly with the `diffusers` library:


```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
from diffusers import StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline

device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
sd_pipe = StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline.from_pretrained(
    ""i3n7g3/Ano-Face-Fair"",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    safety_checker=None,
).to(device)
sd_pipe.load_lora_weights(""i3n7g3/SimPO-LoRA-Diffusion"", adapter_name=""SimPO"")
sd_pipe.set_adapters([""SimPO""], adapter_weights=[0.5])

def generate_image(image_path, mask_path, prompt, negative_prompt, pipe, seed):
    try:
        in_image = Image.open(image_path)
        in_mask = Image.open(mask_path)
    except IOError as e:
        print(f""Loading error: {e}"")
        return None
    generator = torch.Generator(device).manual_seed(seed)
    result = pipe(image=in_image, mask_image=in_mask, prompt=prompt,
                  negative_prompt=negative_prompt, generator=generator)
    return result.images[0]

image = '/content/Ano-Face-Fair/data/2.png'
mask = ""/content/Ano-Face-Fair/data/2_mask.png""
prompt = ""he is an asian man.""

# BeamDiffusion: Latent Beam Diffusion Models for Decoding Image Sequences
**BeamDiffusion** introduces a novel approach for generating coherent image sequences from text prompts by employing beam search in latent space. Unlike traditional methods that generate images independently, BeamDiffusion iteratively explores latent representations, ensuring smooth transitions and visual continuity across frames. A cross-attention mechanism efficiently scores and prunes search paths, optimizing both textual alignment and visual coherence.
BeamDiffusion addresses the challenge of maintaining visual consistency in image sequences generated from text prompts. By leveraging a beam search strategy in the latent space, it refines the generation process to produce sequences with enhanced coherence and alignment with textual descriptions, as outlined in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20429).

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

Before using BeamDiffusion, follow these steps to set up your environment:

```bash
# 1. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv beam_env

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
source beam_env/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# beam_env\Scripts\activate    # On Windows

# 3. Install required dependencies
pip install -r ./BeamDiffusionModel/requirements.txt
```
---
## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

Here's a basic example of how to use BeamDiffusion with the `transformers` library to generate an image sequence based on a series of text prompts:

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
# Download the model snapshot
snapshot_download(repo_id=""Gui28F/BeamDiffusion"", local_dir=""BeamDiffusionModel"")
from BeamDiffusionModel.beam_diffusion import BeamDiffusionPipeline, BeamDiffusionConfig,BeamDiffusionModel

# Initialize the configuration, model, and pipeline
config = BeamDiffusionConfig()
model = BeamDiffusionModel(config)
pipe = BeamDiffusionPipeline(model)
                             
# Define the input parameters
input_data = {
    ""steps"": [""A lively outdoor celebration with guests gathered around, everyone excited to support the event."",
              ""A chef in a cooking uniform raises one hand dramatically, signaling it's time to serve the food."",
              ""Guests chat and laugh in a vibrant setting, with people gathered around tables, enjoying the event.""],
    ""latents_idx"": [0, 1, 2, 3], 
    ""n_seeds"": 4,
    ""steps_back"": 2,
    ""beam_width"": 2,
    ""window_size"": 2,
    ""use_rand"": True
}

# Generate the sequence of images
sequence_imgs = pipe(input_data)
```

**Result:**

![Generated Image Sequence](./example.png)

## 🔍 Input Parameters Explained

- **`steps`** (`list of strings`): Descriptions for each step in the image generation process. The model generates one image per step, forming a sequence that aligns with these descriptions.

- **`latents_idx`** (`list of integers`): Indices referring to specific positions in the latent space to be used during image generation. This allows the model to leverage different latent representations for diverse outputs.

- **`n_seeds`** (`int`): Number of random seeds to use for the generation process. Each seed provides a different starting point for the randomness in the first step, influencing the diversity of generated sequences.

- **`seeds`** (`list of integers`): Specific seeds to use for the generation process. If provided, these seeds override the `n_seeds` parameter, allowing for controlled randomness.

- **`steps_back`** (`int`): Number of previous steps to consider during the beam search process. This parameter helps refine the current generation by incorporating information from earlier steps.

- **`beam_width`** (`int`): Number of candidate sequences to maintain during inference. Beam search evaluates multiple potential outputs and keeps the most probable ones based on the defined criteria.

- **`window_size`** (`int`): Size of the ""window"" for beam search pruning. Determines after how many steps pruning starts, helping the model focus on more probable options as the generation progresses.

- **`use_rand`** (`bool`): Flag to introduce randomness in the inference process. If set to `True`, the model generates more varied and creative results; if `False`, it produces more deterministic outputs.
