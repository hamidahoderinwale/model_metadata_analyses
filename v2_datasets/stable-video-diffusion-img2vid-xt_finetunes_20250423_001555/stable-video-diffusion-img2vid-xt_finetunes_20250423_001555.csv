# Stable Video Diffusion Image-to-Video Model Card

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->
![row01](output_tile.gif)
Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) Image-to-Video is a diffusion model that takes in a still image as a conditioning frame, and generates a video from it. 

Please note: For commercial use, please refer to https://stability.ai/license.

## Model Details

### Model Description

(SVD) Image-to-Video is a latent diffusion model trained to generate short video clips from an image conditioning. 
This model was trained to generate 25 frames at resolution 576x1024 given a context frame of the same size, finetuned from [SVD Image-to-Video [14 frames]](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid).
We also finetune the widely used [f8-decoder](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/models/autoencoderkl#loading-from-the-original-format) for temporal consistency. 
For convenience, we additionally provide the model with the 
standard frame-wise decoder [here](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt/blob/main/svd_xt_image_decoder.safetensors).

# Appendix: 

All considered potential data sources were included for final training, with none held out as the proposed data filtering methods described in the SVD paper handle the quality control/filtering of the dataset. With regards to safety/NSFW filtering, sources considered were either deemed safe or filtered with the in-house NSFW filters.
No explicit human labor is involved in training data preparation. However, human evaluation for model outputs and quality was extensively used to evaluate model quality and performance. The evaluations were performed with third-party contractor platforms (Amazon Sagemaker, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Prolific) with fluent English-speaking contractors from various countries, primarily from the USA, UK, and Canada. Each worker was paid $12/hr for the time invested in the evaluation.
No other third party was involved in the development of this model; the model was fully developed in-house at Stability AI.
Training the SVD checkpoints required a total of approximately 200,000 A100 80GB hours. The majority of the training occurred on 48 * 8 A100s, while some stages took more/less than that. The resulting CO2 emission is ~19,000kg CO2 eq., and energy consumed is ~64000 kWh.
The released checkpoints (SVD/SVD-XT) are image-to-video models that generate short videos/animations closely following the given input image. Since the model relies on an existing supplied image, the potential risks of disclosing specific material or novel unsafe content are minimal. This was also evaluated by third-party independent red-teaming services, which agree with our conclusion to a high degree of confidence (>90% in various areas of safety red-teaming). The external evaluations were also performed for trustworthiness, leading to >95% confidence in real, trustworthy videos.
With the default settings at the time of release, SVD takes ~100s for generation, and SVD-XT takes ~180s on an A100 80GB card. Several optimizations to trade off quality / memory / speed can be done to perform faster inference or inference on lower VRAM cards.
The information related to the model and its development process and usage protocols can be found in the GitHub repo, associated research paper, and HuggingFace model page/cards. 
The released model inference & demo code has image-level watermarking enabled by default, which can be used to detect the outputs. This is done via the imWatermark Python library.  
The model can be used to generate videos from static initial images. However, we prohibit unlawful, obscene, or misleading uses of the model consistent with the terms of our license and Acceptable Use Policy. For the open-weights release, our training data filtering mitigations alleviate this risk to some extent. These restrictions are explicitly enforced on user-facing interfaces at stablevideo.com, where a warning is issued. We do not take any responsibility for third-party interfaces. Submitting initial images that bypass input filters to tease out offensive or inappropriate content listed above is also prohibited. Safety filtering checks at stablevideo.com run on model inputs and outputs independently. More details on our user-facing interfaces can be found here: https://www.stablevideo.com/faq. Beyond the Acceptable Use Policy and other mitigations and conditions described here, the model is not subject to additional model behavior interventions of the type described in the Foundation Model Transparency Index.
For stablevideo.com, we store preference data in the form of upvotes/downvotes on user-generated videos, and we have a pairwise ranker that runs while a user generates videos. This usage data is solely used for improving Stability AI’s future image/video models and services. No other third-party entities are given access to the usage data beyond Stability AI and maintainers of stablevideo.com. 
For usage statistics of SVD, we refer interested users to HuggingFace model download/usage statistics as a primary indicator. Third-party applications also have reported model usage statistics. We might also consider releasing aggregate usage statistics of stablevideo.com on reaching some milestones.

# V1: Human-Centric Video Foundation Model

<p align=""center"">
·<a href=""https://github.com/immortalshadow007/V1"" target=""_blank"">🌐 Github</a> ·
</p>

---
This repo contains Diffusers-format model weights for V1 Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video models, and Video-to-Video. You can find the inference code on our github repository [V1](https://github.com/immortalshadow007/V1).

## Introduction
V1 is an open-source human-centric video foundation model. By fine-tuning <a href=""https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo"">HunyuanVideo</a> on O(10M) high-quality film and television clips, V1 offers three key advantages:

## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Advanced Model Capabilities

1. **Open-Source Leadership**: The Text-to-Video model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models, comparable to proprietary models like Kling and Hailuo.
2. **Advanced Facial Animation**: Captures 33 distinct facial expressions with over 400 natural movement combinations, accurately reflecting human emotions.
3. **Cinematic Lighting and Aesthetics**: Trained on high-quality Hollywood-level film and television data, each generated frame exhibits cinematic quality in composition, actor positioning, and camera angles.

### 2. Self-Developed Data Cleaning and Annotation Pipeline

Our model is built on a self-developed data cleaning and annotation pipeline, creating a vast dataset of high-quality film, television, and documentary content.

- **Expression Classification**: Categorizes human facial expressions into 33 distinct types.
- **Character Spatial Awareness**: Utilizes 3D human reconstruction technology to understand spatial relationships between multiple people in a video, enabling film-level character positioning.
- **Action Recognition**: Constructs over 400 action semantic units to achieve a precise understanding of human actions.
- **Scene Understanding**: Conducts cross-modal correlation analysis of clothing, scenes, and plots.

### 3. Multi-Stage Image-to-Video Pretraining

Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline, inspired by the <a href=""https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanVideo"">HunyuanVideo</a> design, consists of the following stages:

- **Stage 1: Model Domain Transfer Pretraining**: We use a large dataset (O(10M) of film and television content) to adapt the text-to-video model to the human-centric video domain.
- **Stage 2: Image-to-Video Model Pretraining**: We convert the text-to-video model from Stage 1 into an image-to-video model by adjusting the conv-in parameters. This new model is then pretrained on the same dataset used in Stage 1.
- **Stage 3: High-Quality Fine-Tuning**: We fine-tune the image-to-video model on a high-quality subset of the original dataset, ensuring superior performance and quality.

## 📦 Model Introduction
| Model Name      | Resolution | Video Length | FPS |
|-----------------|------------|--------------|-----|
| V1-Hunyuan-I2V  | 544px960p  | 97           | 24  |
| V1-Hunyuan-T2V  | 544px960p  | 97           | 24  |
| V1-SVD-V2V      | 544px960p  | 97           | 24  |

## Usage

**Note**: The V1 model is a hybrid of two models (`tencent/HunyuanVideo` and `stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid-xt`) and cannot be loaded directly using `DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(""NullVoider/V1"")`. Instead, you need to clone the model repository locally and use the inference code provided in the associated GitHub repository.

### Usage Guide

#### 1. Clone the Model Repository Locally

## 🔆 Notice

**GeometryCrafter is still under active development!**

We recommend that everyone use English to communicate on issues, as this helps developers from around the world discuss, share experiences, and answer questions together. For further implementation details, please contact `xutx21@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn`. For business licensing and other related inquiries, don't hesitate to contact `wbhu@tencent.com`.

If you find GeometryCrafter useful, **please help ⭐ this repo**, which is important to Open-Source projects. Thanks!

## 📝 Introduction

We present GeometryCrafter, a novel approach that estimates temporally consistent, high-quality point maps from open-world videos, facilitating downstream applications such as 3D/4D reconstruction and depth-based video editing or generation. This model is described in detail in the paper [GeometryCrafter: Consistent Geometry Estimation for Open-world Videos with Diffusion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01016).

Release Notes:
- `[01/04/2025]` 🔥🔥🔥**GeometryCrafter** is released now, have fun!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TencentARC/GeometryCrafter
```
2. Install dependencies (please refer to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Inference

Run inference code on our provided demo videos at 1.27FPS, which requires a GPU with ~40GB memory for 110 frames with 1024x576 resolution:

```bash
python run.py \
  --video_path examples/video1.mp4 \
  --save_folder workspace/examples_output \
  --height 576 --width 1024
  # resize the input video to the target resolution for processing, which should be divided by 64 
  # the output point maps will be restored to the original resolution before saving
  # you can use --downsample_ratio to downsample the input video or reduce --decode_chunk_size to save the memory usage
```

Run inference code with our deterministic variant at 1.50 FPS

```bash
python run.py \
  --video_path examples/video1.mp4 \
  --save_folder workspace/examples_output \
  --height 576 --width 1024 \
  --model_type determ
```

Run low-resolution processing at 2.49 FPS, which requires a GPU with ~22GB memory:

```bash
python run.py \
  --video_path examples/video1.mp4 \
  --save_folder workspace/examples_output \
  --height 384 --width 640
```

### Visualization

Visualize the predicted point maps with `Viser`

```bash
python visualize/vis_point_maps.py \
  --video_path examples/video1.mp4 \
  --data_path workspace/examples_output/video1.npz
```

## 🤖 Gradio Demo

- Online demo: [**GeometryCrafter**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TencentARC/GeometryCrafter)
- Local demo:
  ```bash
  gradio app.py
  ```

## 📊 Dataset Evaluation

Please check the `evaluation` folder. 
- To create the dataset we use in the paper, you need to run `evaluation/preprocess/gen_{dataset_name}.py`.
- You need to change `DATA_DIR` and `OUTPUT_DIR` first accordint to your working environment.
- Then you will get the preprocessed datasets containing extracted RGB video and point map npz files. We also provide the catelog of these files.
- Inference for all datasets scripts:
  ```bash
  bash evaluation/run_batch.sh
  ```
  (Remember to replace the `data_root_dir` and `save_root_dir` with your path.)
- Evaluation for all datasets scripts (scale-invariant point map estimation):
  ```bash
  bash evaluation/eval.sh
  ```
   (Remember to replace the `pred_data_root_dir` and `gt_data_root_dir` with your path.)
- Evaluation for all datasets scripts (affine-invariant depth estimation):
  ```bash
  bash evaluation/eval_depth.sh
  ```
   (Remember to replace the `pred_data_root_dir` and `gt_data_root_dir` with your path.)
- We also provide the comparison results of MoGe and the deterministic variant of our method. You can evaluate these methods under the same protocol by uncomment the corresponding lines in `evaluation/run.sh` `evaluation/eval.sh` `evaluation/run_batch.sh` and `evaluation/eval_depth.sh`.

## 🤝 Contributing

- Welcome to open issues and pull requests.
- Welcome to optimize the inference speed and memory usage, e.g., through model quantization, distillation, or other acceleration techniques.
