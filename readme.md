# Dataset Schema Design 

Questions asked in development
give a summary of this design choice, and provide a 2-3 sentence summary of its structure that i include as a comment. also would it be possible to have automated data about the dataset itself (f.ex how many model trees, the average depth, etc?)

** Note: Below is partially-generated (by Claude) summary of the dataset schema structure.

This schema is specifically designed for LLM-assisted data collection. Here are the key features:

This approach allows you to:

- Build complete model trees by following parent_model links
- Group models by their base_model for family analysis
- Here, I would imagine that if the nested data in the schema were flattened: you would extract each property into its own column in a table

You could query the data in multiple ways:

- Get all models with base_model = "llama-2-70b" to see the whole family-
- Follow parent_model links to trace specific lineages
- Group by base_model and count derivatives to measure influence

The schema is flexible enough to handle complex cases like:

- Models with multiple parent influences
