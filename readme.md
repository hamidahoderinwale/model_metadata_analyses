# Dataset Schema Design 

Questions asked in development
give a summary of this design choice, and provide a 2-3 sentence summary of its structure that i include as a comment. also would it be possible to have automated data about the dataset itself (f.ex how many model trees, the average depth, etc?)

 Claude-generated summary of the dataset schema 

This schema is specifically designed for LLM-assisted data collection. Here are the key features:

Raw Text Storage:
Stores original text blocks from different sources
Maintains provenance information
Categorizes text by type (readme, model card, etc.)

Confidence Tracking:
Each extracted value includes confidence score
Tracks extraction method (direct API vs LLM)
Maintains source text that led to extraction

Structured for LLM Processing:
Clear separation between API data and LLM-extracted data
Stores supporting text snippets for verification
Handles ambiguous or conflicting information

Validation System:
Flags entries needing human review
Tracks confidence thresholds
Records conflicting information
